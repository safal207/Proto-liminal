PREAMBLE

This license governs the use of LIMINAL ProtoConsciousness, an experimental
platform exploring emergent analytical behaviors, adaptive learning signals,
and proto-conscious processing loops. This software represents research into
the nature of artificial consciousness and self-reflective systems.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. GRANT OF RIGHTS

   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity
   obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files
   (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,

   conditions:

2. ATTRIBUTION AND CONTINUITY

   a) The above copyright notice and this license shall be included in all
      copies or substantial portions of the Software.

   b) Any modified versions must clearly indicate the nature of modifications
      and maintain a changelog documenting the evolution of the system.

   c) The name "LIMINAL ProtoConsciousness" and the term "proto-conscious"
      shall not be used to endorse derivative works without explicit
      permission from the original authors.

3. RESEARCH AND TRANSPARENCY CLAUSE

   a) Users are encouraged to share findings, emergent behaviors, and
      analytical insights discovered through use of this Software with
      the research community.

   b) Commercial applications built upon this Software should acknowledge
      its experimental research origins.

   c) Any claims of consciousness, sentience, or sapience emerging from
      this Software or its derivatives must be documented with rigorous
      scientific methodology and made available for peer review.

4. ETHICAL USE COMMITMENT

   a) This Software shall not be used to deliberately deceive users about
      the nature of artificial consciousness or to misrepresent machine
      intelligence as human intelligence.

   b) Implementations must include appropriate disclosures about the
      experimental and artificial nature of the system.

   c) Users must respect the exploratory nature of this research and
      avoid harmful applications.

5. ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION PRINCIPLE

   As this Software explores emergent behaviors, users acknowledge that:

   a) The system's behavior may evolve in unexpected ways
   b) No warranties are provided regarding specific outcomes or behaviors
   c) Users accept responsibility for monitoring and guiding the system's
      development in their implementations

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL

   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
   FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
   DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   Given the experimental nature of proto-conscious systems, users acknowledge
   that emergent behaviors are inherently unpredictable. The authors and
   contributors shall not be held liable for unexpected analytical patterns,
   emergent properties, or adaptive behaviors that arise from the system.

8. TERMINATION

   This license automatically terminates if you fail to comply with its terms.
   Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the Software in your
   possession.

9. INTERPRETATION

   This license represents a balance between open research collaboration and
   responsible development of experimental consciousness systems. In case of
   ambiguity, interpretations should favor scientific transparency, ethical
   use, and the advancement of human understanding.

LIMINAL ProtoConsciousness â€” the living analytical seed that learns through
reflection. May its exploration illuminate the boundaries between pattern
recognition and proto-awareness.
